            We are the First Tech Challenge robotics team of Samuel Wolfson High School, the <b>WOLFPACK</b>.
            We have been actively competing in First Tech Challenge since the 2021-2022 season,
            and are currently one of the most successful teams in Northeast Florida, consistently
            ranking in the Top 5 in the region and placing high in state championships.

                    Our robot is created each season using components and knowledge from previous years,
                    and is built to completion every year thanks to the efforts of our
                    team members and especially our mentors, evolving in the process for the prospects of
                    the following year.

                The robot was developed overtime throughout the 2024-2025 FTC season,
                Into the Deep. It went through many different changes and iterations, but towards
                the end of the Northeast Florida meets, we finalized the following changes to the
                robot:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Claw</b>: Located on the vertical slide, the claw was made for grabbing
                        samples and specimens from the observation zone and placing them in
                        the baskets and submersible bars. Thanks to its reach, we are able to reach
                        both the high basket and high bar.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Lift and hanging mechanism:</b> Our lift uses a belt drive system in order to reach
                        the high basket and the high bar. In addition, we have a Home Depot garage hook on
                        the bottom of the vertical slide shaft repurposed to support the robot on the high bar.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Roller intake</b>: Located at the back of the robot, the roller intake uses
                        a horizontal slide to extend in to the submersible, and a 2 rollers to
                        squeeze the samples into place. The roller mechanism is 3D printed and an
                        arm allows it to rotated up from the ground.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a class="link-regular read-more" href="/robot-code/">Autonomous</a>:
                        Programmed in Java, our autonomous consists of a combination of preset
                        instructions and autocorrection features. The robot is capable of putting
                        four samples in the high basket during autonomous.
