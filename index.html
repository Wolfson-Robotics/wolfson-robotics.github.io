            We are the WOLFPACK, Robotics team of Samuel W. Wolfson High School.
            We have been actively competing in First Tech Challenge since the 2021-2022 season,
            and are currently one of the most successful teams in Northeast Florida, consistently
            ranking in the Top 5 in the region and placing high in state championships.

                    We are team FTC 19916 of the First Tech Challenge, otherwise known as The WOLFPACK.
                    Our robot is created from the beginning of each season, and overtime near the end
                    of the season the robot nears completion due to the efforts of our team members. Each
                    part of the robot was either the idea of or created by one of our team members who
                    actively fufill the role they chose to take on the team. Every role that a robotics team
                    needs to work is either filled by somebody with previous experience or taught by our past
                    members or mentors, many thanks to:

                The robot was developed overtime over the course of the 2024-2025 FTC Season,
                Into-the-Deep. It went through many different changes and iterations, but towards
                the end of the Northeast Florida meets, we finalized the changes to the robots.
                By the final version of the robot we had a claw, hanging mechanism, roller intake,
                and an autonomous teleOp completed and installed:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Claw: Located on the vertical slide, the claw was made for picking
                        up samples and specimens from the observation zone and placing them in
                        the baskets or submersible bars. Thanks to its reach we are able to reach
                        both the high basket and high bar.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hanging Mechanism: Located on the bottom of the vertical slide shaft,
                        the hanging mechanism was made for reaching 2nd level ascent. The hook
                        on the mechanism is a Home Depot garage hook, and was repurposed for use
                        on the robot to hold on to the high bar.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Roller Intake: Located at the back of the robot, the roller intake uses
                        a horizontal slide to extend in to the submersible, and a 2 rollers to
                        squeeze the samples into place. The roller mechanism is 3D printed and an
                        arm allows it to rotated up from the ground.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a class="link-regular read-more" href="/robot-code/">Autonomous</a>:
                        Programmed in Java, in Android Studio, the Autonomous TeleOp was Programmed from
                        scratch and uses set movements recorded before hand. The robot is 
                        capable of placing up to 4 samples in the high basket during autonomous
                        period.
