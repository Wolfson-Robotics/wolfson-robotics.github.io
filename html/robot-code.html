                    The robot was coded entirely in Java using the Android Studio IDE, which differs to the more
                    beginner-friendly blocks IDE provided by FTC. Although blocks allows the
                    programmer to make basic code for the robot, it simplifies Java and thus removes many
                    pieces of useful functionality of Java.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project is stored on an online repository host called 
                    "<a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>", you can find the 
                    2024-2025 season repository
                    <a href="https://github.com/wolfson-robotics/Into-The-Deep">here</a>.
                    It is reccomended to store code in an online repository to prevent an accident where code
                    is lost and unable to be recovered. Github and many other repositories, uses a file versioning
                    tool called "<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">git</a>", which is reccomended to use 
                    in order to preserve file history to revert changes if needed or to use as progress 
                    record for the portfolio. Either way, both "git" and "GitHub" are free and 
                    will prevent any accidental code loss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The repository is
                    <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo">forked</a>
                    from the original
                    <a href="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController">FtcRobotController</a>.
                    We expand upon this code in TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode, as per
                    FTC's instructions. The robot is built on one initial class called RobotBase.java, which
                    is used in all TeleOp classes as it provides reusable methods and variables reused in
                    in AutoJava.java and DriveJava.java. DriveJava is simple and mainly provides a for loop
                    that iterates over each gamepad button to check if it is active, if it is the corresponding
                    interaction is activated (i.e. moving the joystick up triggers the wheels moving forward).
                    For AutoJava see the below section.

                <p>
                    The Autonomous of our robot is capable of picking up 4 samples and placing them in 
                    high basket within the time limit. To do this there are 2 main components. 
                    The main 
                    <a href="https://github.com/Wolfson-Robotics/Into-the-Deep/blob/main/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/auto/AutoJava.java">AutoJava class</a>
                    and the 
                    <a href="https://github.com/Wolfson-Robotics/Into-the-Deep/blob/main/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/auto/instruct/AutoInstructionReader.java">Debugger</a>.
                    The first component is the Debugger,
                    a custom TeleOp class that records the movements of the robot on to a file that can be
                    reused later. Then that file is fed into the second component, AutoJava, which by translating
                    the saved file values into the code, can replicate the same actions made with the Debugger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the repository AutoJava is extended multiple times in different classes within the
                    auto directory. This is for the purpose of having different auto sequences, like red side
                    4 samples, blue side 4 samples, parking, or specimen hanging. Each new sequence of movements
                    recorded with the Debugger must be implemented in a new class extended off of AutoJava.
