                We expand upon this code in TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode, as per
                FTC's instructions. The robot is built on one initial class called RobotBase.java, which
                is used in all TeleOp classes as it provides reusable methods and variables reused in
                in AutoJava.java and DriveJava.java. DriveJava is simple and mainly provides a for loop
                that iterates over each gamepad button to check if it is active, if it is the corresponding
                interaction is activated (i.e. moving the joystick up triggers the wheels moving forward).
